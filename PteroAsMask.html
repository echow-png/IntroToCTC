        <p>
            You might have seen me represent myself with a pterosaur icon (or multiple). By replacing my physical self with an essentially faceless avatar, I can enable maximal customization, depicting myself as whatever is most suited for any given context.
        </p>
        <p>
            By assigning myself as the "pterodactyl person", I am able to instantly generate any comment or image when asked. "If you could have any pet what would it be?" "What time would you like to travel back to?" "Can you draw something in my sketchbook?" These questions all become much easier to answer.
