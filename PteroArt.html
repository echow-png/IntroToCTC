                Pterosaurs don't all have to be silly. They can be cool too. <br>
                I have six main pterosaurs that have appeared through multiple full illustrations. These are typically rendered fully, with varying degrees of realism.

            <p>
                Each represents one aspect of memory:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>keeper of laws (the Head keeper)</li>
                <li>keeper of knowledge</li>
                <li>keeper of spaces</li>
                <li>keeper of wealth</li>
                <li>keeper of fear</li>
                <li>keeper of connection</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I use them to explore wider, abstract concepts that my other characters do not address. </p>
